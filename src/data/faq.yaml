  - question: Can I be a tour guide if I have another job?
    answer: Many of our campus tour guides work multiple jobs, it is definitely possible to do so as long as you can balance it. However, students cannot apply to be a tour guide if they are Residential Advisors (RAs) because of the time commitment. Additionally, if you work another job for UCLA, you may only work a maximum of 19.5 hours/ week, as per University rules. 
  - question: What is the difference between Academic Year and Year-Round tour guide?
    answer: Academic Year tour guides will work September to June, while Year to Round tour guides are required to also work the first summer that they are hired. This year, we have decided that by allowing applicants to choose what position they apply to, we are able to maintain our tours capacity over the summer while giving our guides the flexibility of what they do over the summer. If you think you are studying abroad, unable to live in Westwood, or plan to have an internship, the Academic Year guide is best for you!
  - question: What is the Summer Tour Guide option on the application?
    answer: Summer Tour Guides are only hired to give tours over the summer. Summer hiring is contingent upon staffing needs. If you fill out the form on the application, we will follow up in March with a better idea of what the staffing needs are. Additionally, if you are hired as a Summer Tour Guide, you would have to reapply if you would like to continue during the school year.
