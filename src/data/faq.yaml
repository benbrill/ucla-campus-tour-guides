  - question: Why is there currently a summer work requirement in the application?
    answer: The 6-week summer work requirement is a university policy and applies to new tour guides for their first year only. If you are unable to stay in Los Angeles during the summer (due to housing related reasons, job/internships, study abroad, or financial concerns) we strongly encourage and invite you to still apply and explain your summer situation in your application. The Summer Requirement is reviewed on a case by case basis and can be waived for tour guides with valid exceptions. Please reach out to apply.uclatours@gmail.com if you have any further questions or concerns.

    answer: Our application is due on October 10 at 11:59 pm!
  - question: What is the hiring process like?
    answer: The hiring process includes three main steps. First, you will submit an online application, responding to all prompts. If invited back, you will then move onto a group interview. Finally, you will be called back to lead a mock tour lasting approximately 5-7 minutes. 
  - question: What is the training process like?
    answer: Once our tour guides are hired, they are trained throughout the following winter quarter in multiple steps, including shadowing tours, giving tours with multiple new tour guides, and tag-teaming a tour with a current tour guide. The training process is extremely supportive and steadily paced, and it ensures that each of our tour guides are fully ready to give solo tours by the end of the quarter!

    answer: Yes! Our tour guides are currently paid $16.25 per hour.

    answer: Work hours can vary depending on season or how much you want to work. On average, each tour guide works about 7 hours per week. 
  - question: Do tour guides get to pick when they work? 
    answer: Our guides’ work schedules are carefully created with priority always given to classes first. Our guides also preference what days and times of days they would prefer to work. 
  - question: Do campus tour guides have to wear a uniform?
    answer: Yes! We wear our iconic blue polos, so guests can easily spot us around campus. 
  - question: Can I be a tour guide if I have another job?
    answer: Many of our campus tour guides work multiple jobs, it is definitely possible to do so as long as you can balance it. However, students cannot apply to be a tour guide if they are Residential Advisors (RAs) because of the time commitment. Additionally, if you work another job for UCLA, you may only work a maximum of 20 hours/ week, as per University rules.
